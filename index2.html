            Doodles are one of the always established elements of human history. People scribble everywhere. Sometimes, they did not realize why they doodle. When they do doodling, the unconscious mind, which is different from their will, dominates and moves their hand. There is no special meaning in their scribbling. We continue to 'scribble' constantly everywhere.

  However, scribbling is not a meaningless act. Doodles show creativity and thinking skills. Developing one's own ability to think differently from others stimulates the brain, develops curiosity, sensitivity, and spontaneity of one's own, and positively affects thinking flexibly.

  Also, it can relieve stress. This is because he expresses his thoughts, dissatisfaction, and feelings through graffiti. 

  However, this stress relief can also be found in many public places. It is found in many public places, including toilets, classroom desks, walls of buildings, etc. Moreover, many people leave their traces on the Internet. They have a strong desire to attract others' attention by creating a homepage where they did not have to express their opinions or create a space where they did not have to leave them. This is a human instinct. Even the self who wants to show off itself strongly helps to unleash one's desire or oppression in human instincts. If space is on the Internet, I will make a space for scribbling. Their instincts are sometimes solved in the wrong way. Thus, I created this room for releasing their stress.
