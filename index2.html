            <h1>What is doodling</h1>
            <p>
                Doodles are one of the always established elements of human history. People scribble everywhere. Sometimes, they did not realize why they doodle. When they do doodling, 
            the unconscious mind, which is different from their will, dominates and moves their hand. There is no special meaning in their scribbling. We continue to 'scribble' constantly everywhere.
            </p>

            <p>
               However, scribbling is not a meaningless act. Doodles show creativity and thinking skills. Developing one's own ability to think differently from others stimulates 
            the brain, develops curiosity, sensitivity, and spontaneity of one's own, and positively affects thinking flexibly.

            <p>
                Also, it can relieve stress. This is because they could expresses their thoughts, dissatisfaction, and feelings in everywhere. They do scribbling in the public places. 
                We all could find easily others doodles in the public places, including washrooms, classroom desks, walls, etc. 
            </p>

                And further more, many people leave their traces or thoughts on the Internet. They have a strong desire to attract others' attention by creating a homepage where they did not have to express their opinions or create a space where they did not have to leave them. This is a human instinct. Even the self who wants to show off itself strongly helps to unleash one's desire or oppression in human instincts. If one of the doodles space is the Internet, 
          I will make a space for scribbling. Their instincts are sometimes solved in the wrong way. Thus, I created this room for express their stress or emotions.
